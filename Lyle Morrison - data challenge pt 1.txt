1. Show how many pageviews occured in the last week

SELECT sum(pageviews) FROM ga_session_views where '8/4/2018' < hit_timestamp < '8/11/2018';



2. Determine how many sessions have organic as a medium

SELECT pageviews, session_id
FROM ga_session_views 
INNER JOIN [ga_session_features] ON [ga_session_views].session_id = ga_session_features.session_id 
WHERE medium = 'organic';



3. Create a list of all nodes with the number of pageviews that came from users with an organic
medium in the last 30 days, with the highest number first.

SELECT pageviews, node_id, session_id
FROM ga_session_views 
INNER JOIN [ga_session_features] ON [ga_session_views].session_id = ga_session_features.session_id 
WHERE medium = 'organic'
AND '7/11/2018' < hit_timestamp < '8/11/2018'
ORDER BY pageviews DESC;



4. Write a query about something that interests you and explain what it does

SELECT *
FROM ga_session_views
INNER JOIN [ga_session_features] ON [ga_session_views].session_id = ga_session_features.session_id 
GROUP BY device_category, DATEPART(HOUR, hit_timestamp) 
ORDER BY sum(pageviews) DESC

This query shows the sum of pageviews grouped first by device and then by the hour of the day.
I'm interested to see how users are interacting with the site at different points during the day. 
For example, they might be accessing the site on desktop during business hours (9am to 5pm) and then on mobile during non-business hours.
Understanding this might help network engineers allocate computing resources more efficently.
Or they might see that there is significatly more mobile traffic than anticipated and provoke them to optimize their site for mobile.
